## Object discovery and localization*

### Introduction
This repository contains the source code of the algorithm described in a  paper (Mining Objects with Multi-scale Features: Object Localization from a Single Unlabeled Image by Frequent Itemset Mining).This package has been tested using Matlab 2014a on a 64-bit Linux machine. This code is for research purposes only. 

You will find a demo 'S_map' file for the VOC2007 6X2 dataset. But you need to download the 
pre-trained VGG-16 model by yourself via http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/pretrained/.

### Installing OLM
0. **Prerequisites** 
 0. To use this package, MatConvNet (http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/) must be available.
 0. [Apriori algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apriori_algorithm): we use [this implementation](http://www.borgelt.net/src/apriori.tar.gz). Click the link to download this package. You need 
    to uncompress it and run `make` to compile it in the `apriori/apriori/src`. 
    Detailed usage of this package can be found [here](http://www.borgelt.net/doc/apriori/apriori.html).
 0. **Configuring OLM**
 0. Download OLM: `git clone https://github.com/Runszhang/Object-Discovery-and-localization.git`.
 0. Copy the executable file `aprior` under directory `apriori/apriori/src` and paste it under `Object Mining` directory.    
 0. Run the `run_demo.m`. It should be working properly for VOC2007 6X2 dataset if you have followed aforementioned instructions. 
 0. You should able run the `visualize.m` to reproduce Fig 1 presented in the paper . 
### Pre-computed support map: PASCAL VOC 2007 6X2 dataset
We provide final support map generated by the proposed algorithm using VGG16.
You should able to reproduce our result presented in the paper 
**PASCAL 2007 6X2 dataset**
    
    After uncompressing the downloaded file,  set the "S_map" and "voc2007_6X2" files to directory (create by yourself), you should be able to run `evaluate.m`
    to reproduce the corloc accuracy presented in the technical report.
